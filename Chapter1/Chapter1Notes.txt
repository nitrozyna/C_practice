In C, all variables must be declared before they are used usually at the beginning of the function before any executable statements.

While loop:
It is good practice to use braces if you have more statements, otherwise you don't have to.

For loop:
1. Initialization
2. Test or condition that controls the loop.
3. After evaluation of the condition if it is true, the body of the loop is executed.
4. The increment step.
The loop terminates if the condition has become false.

If the body of the for loop is empty because all of the work is done in test and increment parts, put a semicolon to satisfy grammatical rules of C.

# define line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters.

# define CONSTANT 0

NOTE: no semicolon at the end of #define line.

Character input and output:

Supported by the standard library. Text input and output is dealt with as streams of characters.

c = getchar() --> the variable c contains the next character of input

putchar(c) --> prints a character each line it is called.

EOF --> End Of File, a value that cannot be confused with any real character.
